= Add a Commiter =
This guide will show Project Owners how to add people to the project so that they can commit changes.

== You Will Need ==
*You must be a Project Owner*

*The email of the person to be added*
 * Gmail is preferred, but other emails should work just fine.

== Step 1: Add the User ==
First, log into your Gmail Account that is a Project Owner for Byond-Survival. Then, from the project's Google Code page, click on the [https://code.google.com/p/byond-survival/admin Administer tab] and then on the [https://code.google.com/p/byond-survival/adminMembers Sharing subtab].

Input the user's email address into the appropriate box, with one email per line.

== Step 2: Things to Remember ==
 * Project Owners have _*complete control*_ over the project! They can add or remove memebers, delete files, or even the entire project.
 * Project Contributors can't commit code to the project.
